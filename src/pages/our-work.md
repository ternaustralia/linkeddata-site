# Our Work

This page lists the data and information standards used and published by TERN Linked Data services.


## TERN Ontology

The TERN Ontology is a conceptual information model to represent plot-based ecological surveys. It defines concepts to describe sites, site visits, features of interest, observations, samplings, and samples. Survey collection protocols generally differ between different programs and organisations. To cater for existing and future survey collection protocols, the TERN Ontology ensures data harmonisation is possible at the core conceptual level while also capturing the intricacies of each survey collection protocol using an extensible framework with SKOS controlled vocabularies.

The TERN Ontology enables a standard representation of ecological survey data for data integration and data exchange. Different systems use the TERN Ontology to exchange survey data using standard RDF serialisations as an exchange format. The TERN Ontology is modelled as a SHACL ontology to ensure incoming and outgoing data conforms to the standard. 

The TERN Ontology is based on existing RDF standards and promotes Linked Data principles to enable FAIR data. Exchanging survey data between different data sources in an agreed standard will substantially improve the quality of the published data and ensure the data is harmonised and interpreted correctly.
